Version: 0.1
Summary: The FlaskContextProvider is a python software that creates a Flask server
    which allows to link a ContextBroker with another service. It is thought to provide real
    time data from sources which might have problems with the traffic that a periodical
    uptateContext suppose, and even so be able to work as a ContextProvider, for instance a
    web service. The software includes the DataManager, a library that makes easier to work
    with ContextBroker responses, so it's relatively accessible to adapt any type of data
    source e to be a ContextProvider.

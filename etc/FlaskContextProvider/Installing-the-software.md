# Installing the software


1. FlaskContextProvider uses a Cache client based on memcached, so for a proper function, it is important to install a [memcached server](http://memcached.org/) before the start of FlaskContextProvider. 

2. Run setup.py in order to install all python required packages
```
   python setup.py install 
```
